## Contribution Guidelines

We ask that you follow these guidelines when contributing to any of our repositories:

* Use the rebase workflow to avoid unnecessary merge commits. This helps us keep a clean & linear commit history that's easy to review. We understand that this workflow can be intimidating for those new to git; please let us know if this is the case, we can help you clean up branch history before merging.
See [this tutorial](https://simondosda.github.io/posts/2022-01-03-git-rebase-workflow.html) for an explanation of the rebase workflow.
* Avoid excessively large commits, as it's difficult for us to review.
* Commit messages should follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). We aren't super strict with these, but we prefer commits that are prefixed with `feat:` `fix:` or `chore:` at least.
* Commit messages should be descriptive. Avoid generic and nondescript messages like "fix: fixed bug" or "fix: mistake".
